Setting Up Script
 
1. Config file
+ Open base/data/setting/config.json
 
+ there are 4 main data that must be changed
  1. site.domain = your domain
  2. drive.client.id = your api client id
  3. drive.client.secret = your api secret
  4. drive.redirect.uris = url redirect.
 please make sure your slash url is correct (using "\/")
 
2. Admin Access (after setting up API)
 login to your website.
 open base/data/user/youremail@gmail.com.json , edit and change "member" to "admin".
 
3. Disable Multi-Resolution Player
  open play.php
  change
  $multi_resolution = "enable";
  to
  $multi_resolution = "disable";
 
Major Problem
1. error when login / profile and picture not appear
this usually cause by lacking folder in base folder, try to extract script directly to your host / server or complete the
missing folder.
 
2. Player not working / multi-res not showing.
 if player not working please try another video, or check if your video is playable on jwplayer. multi-res not show, not every video can be converted, so some video will not have multi-res.
 
3. Subtitle Grabber error
   activate allow_url_fopen and zip function in your server/host
